## <a name="jtag_intro"></a> What is JTAG?
JTAG is an industrial standard for testing and verifying PCB designs after fabricate (Boundary Scan). Besides that, JTAG is often used as an debugger for hardware such as microcontroller like STM32F103C8T6.
  
  
![JTAG Register](https://github.com/jason9829/JTAG_BoundaryScan/blob/b156e726b8d3d7e24953adbeab966ed18cc00d46/resources/images/Figure%201.png)  

<div align="center">
  Figure 1. JTAG Register from [2.]  
</div>  

&nbsp;
    
Based on Figure 1, any JTAG devices will have at least 4 I/O pin (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO) with TRST as optional. For the purpose of this
project, only 4 I/O pins were used.  
  
With so many data lines connected to the device, a controller unit is needed to tell the JTAG device what to do. That control unit is named
Test Access Port (TAP) controller.

![Machine](https://github.com/jason9829/JTAG_BoundaryScan/blob/b156e726b8d3d7e24953adbeab966ed18cc00d46/resources/images/Figure%202.png)  
<div align="center">
  Figure 2. JTAG TAP Controller (State Machine) from [3.]  
</div>  

&nbsp;
  
TAP Controller basiccaly is a 16 states state machine that control the behaviour of JTAG devices. This state machine is controlled by TMS 
and TCK signals. The TMS singals will be captured on the rising edge of TCK. Depend on the current state of the TAP state machine, the JTAG
device can transition to another state to do different operations. For example, if current state is `CAPTURE_DR` which capture the data from 
`External Connections` into `Boundary Scan Register` then a pulse of high TMS and TCK was send to JTAG device. After that, current state 
will be `SHIFT_DR` which will shift data from TDI to TDO.

<br />

## <a name="jtag_instruction"></a>  JTAG Instructions  
### <a name="bypass"></a> 1.BYPASS  
By IEEE Standard 1149.1, the instruction code for BYPASS instruction is all 0b1 (depend length of instruction register). This instruction is used to bypass device(s) that are not tested or to perform some specific region of circuit where are prompt to failure.
By referring to Figure 1, after BYPASS instruction is loaded, TDI and TDO are connected with `Bypass Reg`. The `Bypass Reg` contain one bit of dont't care data. Thus, whenever using BYPASS instruction, there will be numbers of these dont't care data bits depend on how many bypass device(s). `bypass bits = n * 1`.

<br />

### <a name="idcode"></a> 2. IDCODE
JTAG IDCODE is a 32-bit device specific part number. Although it's not a compulsory instruction specified by IEEE, but most JTAG device
have this instruction. Most of the time, the IDCODE of JTAG device is used to get Boundary Scan Information from BSDL files.
By referring to Figure 1, after IDCODE instruction is loaded, TDI and TDO are connected with `Device ID Reg`. If there's only
one device, then shift a 32-bit data from TDI so that the 32-bit device ID can be shifted out from `Device ID Reg`. If there're more
than one JTAG device, then the total number of bits to shift is `shift bits = n * 32`.

Besides, there's another way to get IDCODE of JTAG device that is reset the TAP controller to TEST_LOGIC_RESET state. By resetting
the Tap state machine, the IDCODE instruction will be loaded automatically into `Instruction Register`.

```
After reset, you can read the Device ID Register (default). To perform any other action, you must move 
the TAP to the Instruction Register scan cycle to select an appropriate data register. For either type
of scan cycle (data register or instruction register), the first action in the scan cycle is a capture 
operation. The Capture-DR state enables the data register indicated by the current Instruction 
Register contents. The Capture-IR state enables access to the Instruction Register.
```  
 
<div align="center">
  Snippet 1. Read IDCODE after reset TAP State Machine from [5.] pg 5 
</div>  

&nbsp; 

### <a name="sample_preload"></a> 3. SAMPLE/PRELOAD
This instruction is required by IEEE Standard 1149.1. This instruction connect TDI and TDO through the `Boundary scan register`.  
Thus, SAMPLE/PRELOAD instruction allows user to take a snapshot of the system I/O pins witout affecting the functionality `System logic`.

![Boundary Scan Register Sample/Preload](https://github.com/jason9829/JTAG_BoundaryScan/blob/master/resources/gifs/Gif%201_new.gif)  

<div align="center">
  Gif 1. Boundary Scan Register from [6.] pg 9 
</div>  

&nbsp; 

By default (no shifting), the input pin (PIN_IN), output pin (PIN_OUT) and control pin (PIN_OE) signals are connect to their own multiplexer before `Capture Registers`. After the instruction is loaded then go to `CAPTURE_DR` state, the `PIN_IN` input pin, `OEJ` control pin and `OUTJ` output pin data will be capture by the `Capture Registers` .
After capturing the data (SAMPLE), then proceed to `SHIFT_DR`. At this state, the data wanted to be preload into `OEJ` and `OUTJ`
pin can be shifted in from TDI. After shifting the correct test pattern, then go to `UPDATE_DR` state to update the data to 
`Update Registers`. The preloaded data is now ready for `EXTEST` instruction.  

<br />

### <a name="extest"></a> 4. EXTEST  
This instruction is also a compulsory instruction by IEEE Standard 1149.1. This instruction is often used to test the external
circuitry of the device. For example,
![alt text](https://github.com/jason9829/JTAG_BoundaryScan/blob/b156e726b8d3d7e24953adbeab966ed18cc00d46/resources/images/Figure%203.png "Connection between chips")
<div align="center">
  Figure 3. Example of EXTEST from [2.]
</div>    

&nbsp; 

Based the circuitry on Figure 3, EXTEST instruction can test Stuck-at fault and short circuit between pins/ chips. To test the
Stuck-at fault defect at chip #1, a test pattern of `0bxxxx 1xxx` can be preloaded on chip #1 by using `SAMPLE/PRELOAD` instruction. Then, `EXTEST` instruction can be loaded in chip #1. For chip #2, sample the I/O pins by using `SAMPLE/PRELOAD` instruction. If the
results of sampling shows `0bxxx1 xxxx`. Then, the pin is Stuck-at fault.  
  

![Boundary Scan Register Extest](https://github.com/jason9829/JTAG_BoundaryScan/blob/b156e726b8d3d7e24953adbeab966ed18cc00d46/resources/gifs/Gif%202.gif)  
<div align="center">
  Gif 2. Boundary Scan Register from [6.] pg 9 
</div>  

&nbsp; 

Before using `EXTEST` instruction, the test pattern must be preloaded with `SAMPLE/PRELOAD` instruction. After loading `EXTEST` instruction, go to `CAPTURE_DR` state. In this state, the preloaded data at `Update Registers` will drive `INJ`, `PIN_OE`and `PIN_OUT`.
The next test pattern can be shift in by apply TMS of 1 and a pulse of TCK to go to `SHIFT_DR`. After applying the test pattern, go
to `UPDATE_DR` state to update the `Update Registers` with latest test pattern. Repeat the process by going to `CAPTURE_DR` state if
further `EXTEST` is desired.  

> **Note, me and my [supervisor](https://github.com/chaosAD) noticed that when `EXTEST` instruction is loaded first time, it works fine. But when trying to reload the EXTEST instruction for another test. The MCU seems to regain control of the pin and cause unexpected behaviour. To solve this, if the EXTEST instruction is already loaded and directly shift the data from TDI and TDO. In short, if multiple EXTEST is needed, make sure don't reload the instruction register.**

## <a name="io_signal"></a> JTAG I/O signals
![Example of JTAG waveform](https://github.com/jason9829/JTAG_BoundaryScan/blob/b156e726b8d3d7e24953adbeab966ed18cc00d46/resources/images/Figure%204.png)
<div align="center">
  Figure 4. Example of JTAG waveform from [6.] pg 25  
</div>  

&nbsp; 

When the TAP controller enter `SHIFT_IR` or `SHIFT_DR` state, the first TCK clock cycle does not shift the data from TDI. Instead, at the second TCK clock cycle, TDI and TDO is shifted. By referring from Figure5, when current state is `CAPTURE_DR` then apply TMS of 1 and a pulse of TCK to transition to `SHIFT_DR` state. Then, at the second `TCK` cycle of `SHIFT_DR` the first bits of TDI and TDO is write and read.
```
During the SHIFT_IR state, an instruction code is entered by shifting data
on the TDI pin on the rising edge of TCK. The last bit of the opcode must
be clocked at the same time that the next state, EXIT1_IR, is activated;
EXIT1_IR is entered by clocking a logic high on TMS. Once in the
EXIT1_IR state, TDO becomes tri-stated again. TDO is always tri-stated
except in the SHIFT_IR and SHIFT_DR states. After an instruction code
is entered correctly, the TAP controller advances to perform the serial
shifting of test data in one of three modesâSAMPLE/PRELOAD,
EXTEST, or BYPASSâthat are described below.
```

<div align="center">
  Snippet 2. Documentation from [6.] pg 25  
</div>  

&nbsp; 
  
Based on Snippet 2, on the last bit of data shift, it must be on the next state which is `EXIT1_DR`. 
> Note that the same principle apply to shifting of data and instruction.

## <a name="bsdl"></a> Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL) 
### <a name="bsdlIntro"></a> What is BSDL?  
BSDL is a subset of VHDL which is a hardware description language which provide description on how a particular JTAG device need be
be implemented for boundary scan. There are a few important informations that need to be extract from BSDL file for performing
boundary scan such as:  

* **Device Instructions Opcode**: JTAG boudary  scan instruction opcode and length of the device in binary to perform boundary scan. 
* **Boundary Scan Description**: This description provide the information about the structure of boundary scan cell of the device. 
Most pin on a device will have three boundary scan cells, input, output and control. It also describe what state of the cells pin
are need to perform boundary scan instructions.  
* **Package Pin  Mapping**:  This is used to determine the internal connections within an integrated circuit. It also describe how the
pads of the device are wired to external pins.  
* **IDCODE Register**: This entity specified the device specific IDCODE number of the device.

&nbsp; 
  
Based on Snippet 6, for  
**SAMPLE/PRELOAD**  
In this case, we want to sample the current input status of pin `PC13`. Note the `disval` of cell 215. To disable the output enable, cell 215 need to set to 1. By referring Gif 1. at [here](#sample_preload), when `CONTROL` register is set to HIGH (1), the tri-state output will be disable. Thus, the input data of pin PC13 can be captured.  
 
**EXTEST**  
Let say we want to set the output of pin PC13 to HIGH (1). Based on the `disval` description of control cell (215), to enable the tri-state output buffer, `CONTROL` register is set to LOW (0) so that the preloaded data at `Update Register` of `OUTPUT` can be drive to pin PC13.

By referring to [Boundary Scan Cells and Registers Informations](#bsc_info), we know that the length of boundary scan cell is `232` which mean that we need to shift in 232 bits via TDI. Basically, a I/O is connected to three boundary scan cells (INPUT, OUTPUT and CONTROL). Depend on which instruction used, the datat shift in for boundary scan cells are different.  

<br />

*1. SAMPLE/PRELOAD*
To sample the INPUT boundary scan cell state (0/1). The CONTROL cell are set to 1 to disable the output enable. At the same time, the data wanted to be preload for EXTEST can shift in at the same time.  

<br />

*2. EXTEST*
To do EXTEST operation which set the OUTPUT cell. The CONTROL cell are set to 0 to enable the output enable. Then, the desired OUTPUT state (0/1) preloaded can be drive to the I/O pin. 
> The first bit shifted out from TDO will be the LSB of result. The shifting of all JTAG operations is from LSB to MSB.
